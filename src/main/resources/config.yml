#                    should be shown is sneaking)
#
# - Equipment-Hider: If a player cannot be directly seen by another player his equipment (hand, armour) will be hidden
#                    from the observer. (This will make the life of cheaters harder as they cannot properly estimate
#                    the combat strength of a player)
